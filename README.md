# VITConnect
The aim of this project is to connect students who are in need of a bike companion or a tutor. It aims to provide a platform for students to ask and answer questions, Sell their academic equipment, promoting learning and knowledge sharing among peers.
College students often face difficulties in finding reliable and affordable transportation to their campus. VITConnect addresses this issue by providing a web-based platform that connects students who live in the same area and enables them to share bikes and commute to college together. Moreover, VITConnect offers additional features, such as a community forum for academic discussions, a platform for trading academic equipment, and a peer-to-peer teaching and learning system. These features enhance the overall student experience by fostering a supportive and interactive community within the campus. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of VITConnect, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing the transportation-related challenges faced by college students. The study also highlights the positive impact of VITConnect on the student community, as demonstrated by the feedback obtained from surveys and interviews.
